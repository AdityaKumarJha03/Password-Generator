# Password-Generator
Overview:
This website project allows users to generate a secure password of customizable length that can include a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The application also evaluates the strength of the generated password and visually indicates the strength by changing the color of a password strength indicator.

Features:

Users can specify the desired length of the password (e.g., 8 to 20 characters).
The password is generated with a random combination of:
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special symbols (e.g., @, #, $, %, etc.)
Customizable Password Length:

A slider or input field allows users to set the password length.
The password is re-generated each time the length is adjusted.

Yellow for Medium
Green for Strong
